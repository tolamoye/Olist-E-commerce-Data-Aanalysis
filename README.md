## **INTRODUCTION**
In April, I took part in a data challenge hosted by the Twitter data community. The challenge focused on analyzing a dataset from Olist, a well-known e-commerce company in Brazil. This dataset provided crucial details about various aspects of Olist's operations, such as product listings, sellers, and customer interactions. My objective was to explore the dataset and discover valuable insights based on specific questions. The challenge organizers meticulously curated and prepared the dataset to ensure that participants, including myself, could extract meaningful information and gain insights relevant to Olist's business.
